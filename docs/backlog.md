- **board activity feed** — recent actions as a scrollable panel
- **multi-board view** — split screen with cards from multiple boards
- **card templates** — create cards from saved templates
- **time tracking** — start/stop timer on cards, log to comments
- **webhook listener** — real-time updates via trello/jira webhooks
- **vim mode** — `:` command bar for power users (`:move card to "Done"`)
- **plugin system** — lua or wasm plugins for custom card rendering, actions
- **team presence** — show who else is viewing the board (via provider api)
- **card dependencies** — visualize blocked/blocking relationships
- **swimlanes** — group cards by assignee, label, or custom field
- **bulk operations** — multi-select cards, batch move/archive/label
